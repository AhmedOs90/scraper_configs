The grapes were harvested from dryland farmed vineyards in Darling, where the vines are not trellised and planted as bush vines. De-alcoholised does not mean compromising on taste and this sparkling rosé is made from premium quality grapes bursting with flavour. IN THE VINEYARD Terroir: Vineyards from different slopes and different soils are used for this blend. The cool nights and cool South-westerly wind in the afternoons cool the vineyards down and help to form the elegant fruit flavours. Soil types consist of weathered granite to deep red and well drained soils. Vineyard type: Bush Vine, no irrigation Yield: 6 t/ha Balling at Harvest: 21-22°B WINEMAKING Vinification: Destalk and crush, 18 days fermentation at 14°C. Grapes and juice handled reductively to prevent oxidation and lock in the fruit flavours. Maturation: Left on lees for 2 months to add complexity. The wine is then DeAlcoholised by way of a gently spinning cone technology. This is done under vacuum and at low temperature to ensure that the product retains its distinctive wine body, colour and flavour. Finally, the base wine is infused with CO2 to create a stream of bubbles. WINEMAKER’S COMMENTS Great light salmon pink colour with aromas of ripe strawberries and sweet plum following through to a balanced palate with a lingering finish that leaves you wanting more. FOOD RECOMMENDATION Serve chilled on its own or with a salmon salad, fresh sashimi or yellowtail ceviche.\",\"gluten_free\":null,\"vegan\":null,\"duplicated_with\":null,\"probability\":null,\"site_name\":\"thealcoholfreeco\",\"site_url\":\"https://thealcoholfreeco.co.uk\",\"seller_or_not_seller\":\"seller\",\"classified\":2,\"reason\":\"ABV is unclear\",\"reviewed\":0,\"subcategory\":null,\"cleaned\":0}}}",
