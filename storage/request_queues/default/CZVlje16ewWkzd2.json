All our growers are Fairtrade certified. Winemaking & Alcohol Removal The grapes are picked at full maturity and gently pressed to give a light colour to the must. Fermentation takes place with a cultured yeast at temperatures of between 12 and 14 ° C to enable a slow fermentation process – this creates more of a mouthfeel to the wine. After fermentation, the wine is allowed to remain on the lees for up to 3 weeks, which gives additional complexity. The alcohol is then carefully removed with a vacuum spinning cone process, which allows the alcohol to be removed without affecting the integrity of the wine. The result is a fresh rosé wine with clear strawberry tones, herbs and citrus. An ideal wine as an aperitif on a hot summer day, or for tasty fish dishes and salads.
