All our growers are Fairtrade certified. Winemaking & Alcohol Removal The grapes are picked at full maturity and macerated to extract color and tannins. Fermentation takes place with a cultured yeast at temperatures between 25 and 28Â°C. After the fermentation is complete, the wine is left in the fermentation tank with the skins for another 2 weeks to ensure integration and full development of the tannin structure. The alcohol is then carefully removed using a vacuum spinning cone process. This allows the alcohol to be removed without affecting the integrity of the wine. The result is a nuanced red wine with well-integrated tannins and a taste of red berries and spicy herbs. We recommend that the wine is served slightly cooler than room temperature. Cognato Red works well with meat dishes and tomato based pastas.\",\"gluten_free\":null,\"vegan\":null,\"duplicated_with\":null,\"probability\":null,\"site_name\":\"thealcoholfreeco\",\"site_url\":\"https://thealcoholfreeco.co.uk\",\"seller_or_not_seller\":\"seller\",\"classified\":2,\"reason\":\"ABV is unclear\",\"reviewed\":0,\"subcategory\":null,\"cleaned\":0}}}",
