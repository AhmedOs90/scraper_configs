The grapes were grown in San Luis Obispo County, a region of California known for producing high quality fruit. WINEMAKING: Cabernet Sauvignon is fermented and aged in the traditional red wine method: fermentation is done in stainless steel cooperage on the skins at temperatures above 75F (24C). After fermentation, the wine is separated from the skins and a portion is moved into a combination of French and American oak barrels for extended aging. Just prior to bottling, the alcohol is gently removed by cold filtration. WINEMAKER NOTES: The Wine is rich in color and flavor, oak-aged Cabernet Sauvignon offers aromas of blueberries, blackberries, black pepper and chocolate, with a hint of toasty oak, soft tannins and a dry finish. At its optimum maturity eighteen months after bottling, it can be enjoyed immediately or held for up to five to seven years before enjoying. Serve with beef, lamb, and heavily sauced pasta dishes.
