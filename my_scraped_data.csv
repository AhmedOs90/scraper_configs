I was very rare to jump on a white; only ever in dining out scenarios and always accompanied by seafood. But for you dear reader I will always give this a crack. It looks like a wine, it SMELL’s like a wine and it tastes… like a wine! A beautiful Pinot Grigio without the dehydration, the headache and the spew in the taxi! This wine is light, crisp, a good balance of sweet and dry and generally a delight. I’m getting nashi pear, crisp apple but with a bit of an edge. A bit of chew in the mouth and a really well rounded feel. There is no chance you have mistakenly let an ice cube dissolve in this baby! A lovely summer delight, would go so nicely with a seafood dinner or a light curry. This is low sugar & vegan friendly. Definitely one to try.

Like will only drink in desperate times of need (you know those times, when ALL other booze at the party is exhausted). But I do recognise and recommend a good non alcoholic Sauvignon Blanc when I taste one, Giesen’s Savvy B is a case in point. I’ve tried 1920’s Pinot Grigio and it is a good one, so it is only fair to give the Sauvignon Blanc a run too. I’ve got good and bad news for you, depending on how you feel about a Sauv Blanc. I find this actually quite drinkable and not at all repellent, therefore it doesn’t have those true characteristics you’d expect. One whiff of the Giesen and I knew it was all over. With the 1920 I’m not getting those typical passionfruit notes at all. I’m searching hard, they are just not there. This wine is on the dry side, quite acidic, really balanced. In a blind taste test, my Mum took it for a Chardonnay. So unless you are really into a strong Sauvignon Blanc profile, you are in for a treat with this alcohol free white wine, it is one of the best I have tried!

I find 1920 Wines to give a decent offering, their Pinot Grigio I regularly include in my tasting events, the Sauvignon Blanc, not so much. In the glass this has a lovely warm salmon hue, a nice bold pour. On the nose this is quire restrained. Slightly floral, but generally non distinct. In the mouth? It is pretty good. It’s fruity, but dry. There is some complexity there, with a nice slightly smoky profile. A little bit of chew, nicely balanced, good body but I think it’s let down slightly in the length. Not lingering on the palette like some of the better non-alcoholic wines can do. Certainly not offensive and a nice easy summer drop.

Like get a second mortgage and invest in a palette load good! From first sniff I was feeling positive. It smells like the real deal. But as we all know, our noses can be deceiving! My nose was not lying! This red is robust, full bodied, tannic and beautifully savoury. There are rich red berry notes but there is no cloying sweetness, its so so well balanced. I’d say it’s on par with Lautus and funnily enough also from South Africa…they are onto a good thing in SA! While Lautus has your oak, this Merlot does not, or is significantly light on with it.

Up until this point there has been only one contender for me for a GOOD bottle of alcohol free white, and that is Next Destination’s excellent Chardonnay. As with all my Sauvignon Blanc reviews, I must preface this by letting you know that I was never a Savvy B fan in general. But I do know what they are supposed to taste like and will review it from that standpoint. Almost Zero make quite good non-alcoholic wines. I am particularly partial to their red. In the glass this wine pours quite a vivid yellow, on the nose I get no outstanding Sauvignon Blanc characteristics. I gave it a waft under Mum’s nose and she thought it was a Chardonnay! Similarly, the Savvy characteristics are not there in the mouth. I like it! (haha). As with their red, it is dry and tart, with a slightly smokey undertone. A little on the acidic side, but it is certainly not watery or lacking in depth. So many non-alcoholic whites are sweet or thin and this is neither. Definitely worth a go!

They use they same distillation process as alcoholic spirits but they are all so gentle, nuanced and unique. Don’t go in thinking, this will taste like Gin. Because it wont, but it is a very enjoyable drinking experience. ALTD Green Grocer is all of those things. Subtle with beautiful native botanicals, I get lemon myrtle, bitterness from the lemon peel and green grapefruit and a dry finish thanks to the Tasmanian Pepperberry. I had to be quite heavy handed and had to go more than the recommended 50ml pour for it to cut through the tonic, but once I got the balance right it was just a delight. Would also be good with a quality sparkling mineral water and squeeze of lemon. These spirits are alcohol-free, sugar-free, calorie-free and vegan-friendly.

It’s dry, delicious and full of good winey flavour. So when Altina launched their new range of still dealcoholised, native-infused wines, I was very excited to give them a try. First cab off the rank is this Kakadu Plum Rosé. A blend of alcohol removed Sauvignon Blanc, Shiraz and native Kakadu Plum. In the glass this pours a beautiful deep warm pink hue. On the nose it’s rich, a little sweet with that lovely hint of tart plum coming through. In the mouth, this is a delight. It’s definitely a a unique non alcoholic rosé, but a delicious one. It’s full bodied, tart and there is a beautiful bit of warmth that come from some added spices. It’s really well balanced and though sweet, it’s not overwhelmingly so. Even though obviously you’d drink this slightly chilled, the spices give you a bit of heat that makes this acceptable even on a winters day. Would be lovely with a robust grazing platter or a rich pasta or curry. That bit of acidity cuts through nicely! Can’t wait to try the rest of the range!

This lightly sparkling non-alcoholic rose cocktail is refreshing and subtle. It’s not attempting to mimic any particular alcoholic experience so doesn’t feel like it’s failing any attempts there.

These are individually crafted, ready to drink cocktails that don’t mimic an alcoholic product. Light Me Up features flavours of Apple, Forestberry, and Wattleseed. You get sweetness from the apple but also a dry finish from the green tea. There is also a nice little warming burn thanks to a sprinkling of cayenne pepper extract. Whilst the complexity is there and you do get a nice full palette of flavours; it’s a little too sweet for me and I prefer La Vie En Rose of the two Altina offerings. I do prefer Light Me up over the TÖST. They are quite similar in terms of flavour profiles, but I find TÖST more sickly sweet than the Altina. Again the thing that’s missing for me is the balance of some acidity, but I really do have a high threshold for sour!

She’s not overwhelmingly sweet, but still too sweet for my liking. The main thing missing to me is any body or depth of flavour. There is no robustness or richness there (as we know is generally the case with many of the non alc reds!)

There’s Pepperberry for heat and lemon myrtle and lime for a balancing blend of citrus. On first try I found the cinnamon profile TOO strong, and I quite love cinnamon. But I’ve found the stronger citrus vibes of a Fentiman’s Pink Grapefruit Tonic are the perfect compliment for the Banks Botanicals blend. That tartness is the perfect balance.
