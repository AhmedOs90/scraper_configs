The MESA V2 continues to maximize ease to minimize error, which allows parents to move forward with confidence and security. Its SMARTSecure System combines auto-retracting LATCH connectors and a visual indicator that turns from red to green, providing an installation that is both simple and accurate. Front adjust no-rethread harness with integrated side impact protection as well as a one-handed release from both the VISTA and the CRUZ deliver a seat that effectively pairs safety with simplicity.Protection From All Sides: The adjustable headrest is reinforced with EPP foam to help absorb energy while the integrated design of our Side Impact Protection keeps baby’s head protected during a collision. Additionally, the 4th rebound carry handle position allows for increased safety and aids in absorbing rebound forces.SMART Secure System: UPPAbaby makes installation quick and simple by combining their innovative SMARTSecure system, auto-retracting LATCH design, red to green tightness indicator, and four-position adjustable foot.European Routing: European Routing provides a safe and secure carrier-only installation when the use of a base isn’t convenient. The belt path easily secures the carrier at three points of contact to reduce movement.Robust Infant Insert: The removable infant insert is designed to provide better fit and body positioning for babies approximately 4 – 11 lbs.Fire Retardant Free Fabrics: The MESA V2 is made with fabric that is free from fire retardant chemicals for all fashions and textiles, including the large UPF 25+ hideaway canopy. It is also GREENGUARD GOLD Certified to support healthier air quality and low chemical emissionsBuckle Up with Confidence: UPPAbaby's simple one-crotch buckle position and no-rethread, adjustable harness makes buckling up a breeze.Performance Travel System: For the ultimate in portability and safety, MESA V2 directly attaches to both the VISTA and CRUZ strollers. It is even compatible with the MINU and RIDGE with the addition of convenient adapters. This creates a stylish and simple solution that goes from drive to stroll (and back again).Convenient Release Button: A quick press of the button on the top of the carrier handle releases it from the frame so you can go from stroller to car in one seamless motion. Additionally, the convenient, reversible option allows baby to face you while strolling, or you can turn the carrier to pull right up to a table for mealtime.Hideaway Canopy with UPF 25+: The extra-large integrated, extendable canopy provides more protection outside and conveniently tucks away when not in use.Specifications: Suitable 4-35 lbs and up to 32″ in height, whichever comes firstCar Seat dimensions: 17″W x 25.8″L x 23″HCar Seat on base dimensions: 17″W x 28″L x 25″HCar Seat base-only dimensions: 14.5″W x 21.3″L x 10.3″H Play UPPAbaby's video on Youtube.
