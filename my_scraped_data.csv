Born out of a mutual appreciation between Sobremesa & Hop Nation — for wine, New Zealand, good food, and not taking life too seriously — this beer captures that spirit of simple pleasure and connection. This is a blend of: 60% – 20 month old saison fermented in a puncheon 40% – freshly packaged ‘The Chop’ IPA from hop nation. Packaged on August 10th 2025 and bottle/keg conditioned for 10 weeks. This is one of our favourite styles at Sobremesa. There is such a beauty in blending young and old components that always results in a product that is better then the sum of it’s parts. For this release, we used finished IPA for the first time rather than dry-hopping the blend, resulting in a more refined, cohesive expression. The aroma is full of apricot & lime zest and sings in the glass. The palate brings a real lemon sherbet character w/ a subtle acidity. The bitterness is fresh and sustained. Crisp, bright, and crunchy. – Sobremesa",,,,,mrwest,https://mrwest.com.au,seller
