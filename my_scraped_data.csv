We think it would be fantastic as a brunch wine, especially when served with salty bacon and creamy eggs, or with an open sandwich with cheese and crunchy salad. You could really pair this with just about anything really, although it's not a heavyweight wine so best to avoid very strong flavours. keyvalueFOODBrunch, saladTASTESFresh, SaltyMOODSCelebratory, CreativeSEASONSSpring, Summer RECIPE MATCHES Bacon and Egg SaladMango and Spicy Chickpea SaladChicken Stuffed with Goat’s Cheese",,,,,goodpairdays,https://www.goodpairdays.com,seller

The breakfast part is important because bacon and eggs are an unlikely hero pairing, especially with the juicy, fresh fruit of this wine contrasting with the salty bacon. It's otherwise a fantastic brunch wine, especially with salads that incorporate richer sauces, fresh and zesty pasta and pasta salad, grilled seafood, salty noodles and rice based dishes that have a salty edge to them. keyvalueFOODPicnic, SaladsTASTESCrisp, DelicateMOODSAlways a Winner, RelaxedSEASONSAutumn, Spring, Summer RECIPE MATCHES Bacon and Egg SaladChirashi BowlCrispy Tofu Noodles",,,,,goodpairdays,https://www.goodpairdays.com,seller

Not only does it taste great and deliver no shortage of satisfaction, it’s a brilliant choice for food pairing, too. We loved it with breaded and fried fish, white meats and veggies, and found it worked especially well with meat-free burgers and ingredients like fried tofu and paneer. However, you’ll get equally good results with aged charcuterie, katsu curry and Hong Kong sweet and sour chicken or pork, as well as with strong cheeses and loaded fries or nachos.
