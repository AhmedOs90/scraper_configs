Notes of apple and pear lead to a medium bodied wine with stone fruit and lemon rind on the palate. Assertive bubbles and mellow acidity provide structure, and a touch of sugar adds a dimensionality to the fruit notes that might otherwise feel muted. The wine does not taste sweet though, and the finish feels quite dry. The beautiful gold hue and understated bottle will elevate any occasion, whether you pop it for yourself on a casual night in or are celebrating a major milestone with friends and family. We are big believers in bubbles for all occasions - they just bring a smile to your face. Glimmer is a welcome addition to BC's growing roster of producers taking on alcohol free drinks, and they're making one of our favourite drinks - sparkling wine!!! *For the technical wine lovers out there, the wine is actually made with the charmat method, aka, the carbonation is introduced before bottling - it just works better this way for de-alcoholised wines.",,,,,softerdrink,https://softerdrink.ca,seller

Dried plums, herbs, minerality, contrasts, textures. The name of this wine is a touch provocative, but knowing that Oddbird's founder is a former social worker makes me trust it was not chosen lightly. It is a serious concept to go along with a serious wine - but you can enjoy this wine without any heaviness. Bringing conversations into the open is a great way to reduce stigma. About Oddbird Oddbird was founded in 2013 by a family counsellor and social worker. She speculated that there was a stigma around non-alcoholic wines, and that their poor quality and flavour negatively impacted their effectivess as a non-alc option. Her solution - push wineries to make de-alcoholised wines of higher quality, and to take them seriously so that consumers might as well. Whether you're totally sober or simply looking for options to support a more mindful relationship to alcohol, Oddbird make great wines to reach for and is constantly pushing to find new winery partners willing to swing big from a quality and flavour standpoint.

Barley, wheat, and oats on the grain bill result in texture and depth, but overall the beer is lighter in body than your typical ""alcoholic"" IPA. The hop profile, using Citra and HBC-638 from Yakima Valley, is pure juice and tang. A really interesting profile overall, neither hazy/tropical nor particularly West Coast or piney. To us, it's uniquely reminiscent of the briefly hyped-up ""Brut IPA"" style. Remember those? Bone dry, aromatic but not overtly bitter, with a kind of chalky graininess that almost says ""minerality"". A fine cuvée indeed! For those of you who abstain all the time, we salute you, and hope you enjoy this IPA from a great Ontario craft brewery.
