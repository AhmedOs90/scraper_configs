1,Adnams Wild Wave Cider,0.5%,Adnams,Cider,,,1.50,GBP,UK,https://thelightdrinker.com/product/adnams-wild-wave-cider/,https://thelightdrinker.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adnams-Wild-Wave.jpeg,"The branding is great – the curling breaker in lime green against a blue sky and seagulls sings of this cider’s Southwold origins. So, it’s already a little disappointing when the anticipated splash of zesty seaside flavour fails to crash down on you at first sip. The pour is nice and fizzy, but the nose is a let-down. Not so much a wave of fragrant apple as the distant whiff of a sun-cooked windfall that’s been crushed underfoot. In the mouth, there’s flat-sour hesitancy at first, not a lot of flavour popping on the tongue or astringency on the cheek, but neither is it unpleasant or watery. In fact, the mouthfeel is very good, a subtle fizz, and while there’s a not a huge amount of apple (or anything else much) initially, it develops slowly and hits the back of the mouth with a tang of sour apple, followed by a short finish that doesn’t linger for long in the throat. Overall then this is a perfectly drinkable, even quite refreshing cider. But it is also one note (even at that, you have to wait for it to come) with a sense that it’s missed the point of being a cider, or just not quite firing on all cylinders. Not a big hit with this reviewer, then, although if you do like your ciders to keep their sweet-apple origins under wraps, or simply to be on the sourer end of the flavour scale, I can see how this might well fit the bill. Makers’ notes: “A fully fermented cider, blended with a mix of bittersweet and dessert apple juice for a distinctively English cider taste. Refreshing, juicy and delicious”",Gluten free,Vegan,,,thelightdrinker,https://thelightdrinker.com,no
2,Sheppy’s Low Alcohol Classic Cider,0.5%,Sheppy’s,Cider,,,1.80,GBP,UK,https://thelightdrinker.com/product/sheppys-low-alcohol-classic-cider/,https://thelightdrinker.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Sheppys-Low-Alcohol-Cider.jpg,"Attractive packaging (traditional squat brown bottle, heritage-evoking labels) and the reassurance that “every drop” of Sheppy’s is crafted by a sixth-generation master of cider, set up expectations of a high-quality low alcohol (0.5% vol) product that were fully met. In fact, from pour to finish, this go-low cider from one of the UK’s leading craft producers smacks of real class and no compromise whatsoever. Sheppy’s has making cider for 200 years, so you would expect it to know how a good cider should look and taste, with or without alcohol. Even so, it is still a pleasant surprise to pop off the cap and get a reassuring waft of dry apple as the pale straw colour fills the glass. On the palate the flavour is deep and dry and the apple never overwhelms. There is a subtle tickle of fizz before the kiss of apple hits your cheeks and deepens at the back of the throat for a long, satisfying finish. The balance of fruit and acidity feels just right, refreshing but complex enough to make you want to savour it over and again – enough to want to order another one, and then a case. All in all, a sophisticated quaffer’s drink to enjoy once as refreshing pick-me-up once or to happily indulge in all evening long.",Gluten free,Vegan,,,thelightdrinker,https://thelightdrinker.com,no
3,Adnams Southwold 2020 Marlborough Riesling,9.5%,Adnams,Wine,,,9.00,GBP,UK,https://thelightdrinker.com/product/adnams-southwold-2020-marlborough-riesling/,https://thelightdrinker.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Adnams-Southwold-2020-Marlborough-Riesling.jpg,"I don’t think any of us will be surprised to discover that this Adnam’s own label wine is in fact being made by the great John Forrest, maker of The Doctors wines (winning two of our 5-star ratings) and pioneer of the New Zealand lower alcohol wine movement. With this pedigree, Adnams was assured of getting an uncompromised new world Riesling – 9.5% ABV, delightfully dry and packed with flavour. Kumquat, apples, citrus, lychees, apricots and (I suppose inevitably) kiwis tumble across your taste buds, balanced with a lively, even possibly spritzy, acidity that for our panel just strayed into the overly citrus, hence our 4.5 rating. But I think others will give it a straight 5, as what the acidity brings is an assured dryness. Indeed, I think this must be the driest 9.5% Riesling that a human could make. This is a great addition to the Adnams lower ABV range of classic wines and I believe will become a staple of The Light Drinker’s cellar.",,,,,thelightdrinker,https://thelightdrinker.com,no
4,Infinite Session IPA,0.5%,Infinite Session,Beer,,,1.50,GBP,UK,https://thelightdrinker.com/product/infinite-session-infinite-ipa/,https://thelightdrinker.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/DSC03459-scaled-e1635616099260.jpeg,"An India Pale Ale from the prodigiously talented UK alcohol-free specialists at Infinite Session. Again, the restrained yet sophisticated branding – this time with a zingy blue band – sets up expectations of a quality craft beer experience. And again, expectations are not disappointed. Popping the ring pull reveals a subtle aroma of floral hop and nutty, darker undertones; the pour is quite lively for an IPA, with a loosely bubbling head that quickly dissipates to a minimum over the pale amber of the beer. In the mouth, it’s mostly sharp citrus – the mouthfeel a little thin with that dry hop dominating almost to the exclusion of all else, though hints of caramel nuttiness kick in just before the medium-long, hop-heavy finish. Overall, we found the dominating citrus a bit one-note, but that clearly wasn’t an opinion shared by the World Beer Awards jury that gave this IPA the bronze medal in a field packed with full-alcohol rivals in its Session IPA category. And, really, that’s the whole point with Infinite Session beer. It tastes exactly like beer should – and like some of the best beer in the world, at that. Yes, those with a taste for drama and complexity and sheer joie de vivre might find more to shout about in Infinite’s utterly barnstorming American Pale Ale. But if it’s a very decent beer you’re after, only without the alcohol (and a staggeringly low calorie-count), you won’t go wrong with this one.",,Vegan,,,thelightdrinker,https://thelightdrinker.com,no
5,Lucky Saint Unfiltered Lager,0.5%,Lucky Saint,Beer,,,1.80,GBP,UK,https://thelightdrinker.com/product/lucky-saint-unfiltered-lager/,https://thelightdrinker.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Lucky-Saint.jpg,"One of the most high-profile of the new generation of craft alcohol-free lagers, Lucky Saint is a beer we were particularly keen to try. Brewed in Germany by an English maker, the blue and white branding on trad brown bottle suggests simplicity and honesty while the on-label references to Bavarian spring water and Hallertau hops prepares us for an essentially Teutonic experience. And so it proves. The first things to notice are the exceptionally fine white head and a cloudiness in the pour that attests to its unfiltered production method and summons up memories of foaming steins of pils and, even, German weisbeirs. In the mouth, it is pils all the way, the nose a mild hoppy citrus, with a mouthfeel that foams and waits a millisecond before revealing its secrets – a lemony dry flavour-burst of hop on the palate that lingers only minimally before washing down the throat with a gently foaming finish. Overall, while not as crisp as some might expect of a lager, if your go-to taste is a German blond this could well be the drink for you.",,Vegan,,,thelightdrinker,https://thelightdrinker.com,no

Its name means “spice garden” and the red, volcanic, slatey soils of this vineyard are known for producing a wine with an earthy mineral flavour and a distinct sharpness, described by some as spicy or peppery, but to us a little too astringent – described by one of us as “biting the back of my throat”. Of course, this does provide a balance to the classic Riesling fruitiness, and some will enjoy its fieriness and lingering finish – so this is definitely one to try if you’re enjoying exploring the world of Rieslings.",,,,,thelightdrinker,https://thelightdrinker.com,no

Big Drop’s spot-on branding highlights tropical greens and citrus yellows but nothing can prepare you for the sheer bombardment of aroma and flavour that explodes out from the moment the ringpull gives way – sparkling grapefruit florals on the nose, a pour that pops and fizzes with enthusiasm into the glass and a flavour range that leaps delightfully from lemon on the tongue to hoppy malty depth on the palate, and back again – combining ingeniously once more down the back of the throat for a long, sensationally satisfying finish. As light as a lager but with all the flavour depth of a real ale, Big Drop’s Paradiso is a thirst-slaking masterpiece of beer-making",Gluten free,Vegan,,,thelightdrinker,https://thelightdrinker.com,no

So, it was something of a surprise to find this lager is all about subtlety and elegance and nothing like as big, bold and whack-you-round-the-chops as some of their more idiosyncratic styles (Citrus IPA and Pine Trail, come to mind ). Still, for all its subtlety, this foaming, creamy smooth, pilsner-like lager certainly delivers on both flavour and satisfaction – mixing luscious creamy-on-the-tongue toffee notes with a refreshing hint of orangey citrus on the palate. A double gold winner at the 2019 European Beer Challenge, if subtlety, tact and moreish-ness are top of your wish list, you really won’t be disappointed.",Gluten free,Vegan,,,thelightdrinker,https://thelightdrinker.com,no

Freshness and the joy of sourness are the takeaways here, each mouthful throwing out a big punch of bitter fruit that sends a fabulously satisfying tang of freshness to the back of the throat while apple-peel top-notes pop on the tongue and linger on the palate. There’s something wonderfully earthy about putting the sourness front and centre here, summoning up images of heat-drenched harvest days, dusty late-summer wheat fields, mopped brows and a thirst the size of a bucket that needs quenching. This is low alcohol without obvious compromise and while it might not be the most complex of ciders there’s a subtlety to the sourness that keeps it just the right side of bitter. It also brings a winning liveliness to the table, with an individuality of flavour that might well convince you, if you need convincing, that bittersweet can be a wonderful thing.",Gluten free,Vegan,,,thelightdrinker,https://thelightdrinker.com,no

This wine is also available as a secco but then you rise to 11% ABV.

The result is firstly a wine that is actually green, unlike most wines bearing the “verde” name (most makers play to this green identity by using light blue bottles through which their otherwise yellow wines appear as green). Secondly the wine has an unusual depth of flavour and is distinctly dry, being always balanced with a certain limey acidity. So this is definitely a wine that’s worth trying as something a little different. My only quibble with it is the spritz is light and dies away quickly. This appears to be a house style, also shown in Aveleda’s Casal Garcia range, which is similarly sealed with a cork. But some I think will enjoy this the more for that.",,,,,thelightdrinker,https://thelightdrinker.com,no

It is a classic Riesling with an underlying fruitiness balanced with an acidic finish.

The nose is a slightly flat mix of caramel and subtle citrus, the pour nice and lively, with a bright white foamy head that has plenty of staying power. Again, sweet caramel malt is the dominant flavour, with citrus hints popping in the cheeks and leading to short bitter finish. Good and cold this is a great accompaniment for a barbeque on a hot afternoon and, apart from the buzz, there’s not much else missing from this solidly satisfying performer.",,,,,thelightdrinker,https://thelightdrinker.com,no

The nose is subtle, the faintest hint of rose sitting beside freshly unwrapped toffee, something indefinably clean and pure to it. In the mouth there’s that hint of rose again, set deep inside an overall complexity of creamy caramel and citrus – a refreshing limey crispness in the cheeks yet balanced by something deeper and darker on the palate with a hoppy bitterness at the back of the throat that contributes to a lovely long finish. The one thing we didn’t get was pine – thankfully perhaps – but maybe that was what contributed to the apparent cleanness of the nose, so subtle as to have more to do with mood than flavour. All in all, this is an utterly intriguing – and delightful – beer that appeals as much to the head as to the throat. Having confidently done its main job of refreshing, relaxing and satisfying, it sets about posing questions to the drinker. Like: what exactly is this mix of weirdly wonderful flavours and how did they get them to marry up so well? The answer, clearly, is all in the balance of the Magnum, Mosaic and Amarillo hops mentioned on the can – although Milk features as well, so who knows? But that’s for the geeks. For our part, the most pressing question this beer asked was: can we get another round of these in, please?",Gluten free,,,,thelightdrinker,https://thelightdrinker.com,no

A gloopy red sherbet-sweet concoction that only a child could love. I couldn’t get enough of it. Too long has passed for me to swear Kopparberg Alcohol-Free Cider with Mixed Fruits tastes just like it; but, apart from the syrupiness – the fizzy dance of Kopparberg in the mouth is actually very refreshing – my sense memory tells me that it does. Other flavours that come to mind are Ribena, wine gums, Drumstick lollies and Love Hearts. Maybe even alcopop – although I never tried an alcopop that tasted as nice as Kopparberg. One thing Kopparberg does not speak to me of, though, is… cider. I get no sense of apples at all, although an undercurrent of astringency clearly balances out the waves of fruit-juicy sweetness and the ingredients attest that it contains fermented apples, juice (apple, blackcurrant, elderberry, raspberry) sugar, etc. And the intense fizz gives it a refreshing fillip and an enjoyably vivid mouthfeel – as long as it is suitably chilled. So, while it might not be one for the full-on cider purist, this is certainly a very drinkable, even quite refreshing cider.",Gluten free,Vegan,,,thelightdrinker,https://thelightdrinker.com,no
