His wines are not influenced by trends, opinion leaders’ tastes or fads. Instead, the Grau wines are authentic and deeply imbued with the essence of place: Grau is convinced that outstanding wines can be made with very little, avoiding artifice and respecting the natural language of the vineyard. Grau currently oversees 64 acres (26 ha) of vineyards in D.O.Q. Priorat and D.O. Montsant. The vineyards are at varying elevations with llicorella (slate), chalky clay and pebbly decomposed granite. Vineyards in Capçanes formed the basis of the early wines, and remain a part of Josep Grau bottlings. In 2016 Josep purchased a 17th century house in Gratallops and it became the winery and cellar. 15 acres (6 hectares) of vineyards, divided into four plots, became part of the new, expanded Josep Grau Viticultor. With this heritage, they embarked on a new project to make fine, delicate wines, a style that is the now the house’s trademark. Viticulture follows organic principles (certified in Spain), and is herbicide and pesticide free. Garnacha Blanca, Garnacha Tinta, Samsó, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Syrah are grown. – Producer’s Notes",,,,,mrwest,https://mrwest.com.au,seller
