Tastes like a spirit. Mixes like a spirit. <0.5% ABV. Enjoy the thrill of throwing back a dram of the world's finest non-alcoholic spirit, with none of the headaches. WHAT'S IN IT? The Pathfinder is fermented from hemp and carefully refined by copper pot distillation. We then blend with an alchemy of wormwood, angelic root, ginger, sage, juniper, saffron, orange peel, wild-crafted Douglas-fir and natural terpenes to yield this revolutionary spirit of both complexity and character.

The Pathfinder tastes like an amaro, that fine class of European liquors known for bittersweet flavours rounded out by citrus and spice, and can be used as a flavourful substitute for amaro, whiskey, or vermouth. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I DRINK IT? This miraculous elixir, like the hemp plant itself, has no psychoactive effects, yet contains enough vitamin E, antioxidants, and other nutrients, to go favourably hand-in-hand with a balanced diet. And since there's no alcohol in The Pathfinder, it won't give you a hangover, either. Make it a cocktail box! Why not add on our hand selected mixers that pair perfectly with Pathfinder?
